#  TMRM: A Temporal Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for 24-Hour Activity Cycle Modeling and Metabolic Syndrome Risk Prediction

We developed a unified deep learning framework termed **TMRM (Temporal Multimodal Risk Model)** to model the **24-hour activity cycle (HAC)**—including sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sleep—and predict the risk of **metabolic syndrome (MetS)**, including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Unlike conventional approaches that focus primarily on total activity volume, TMRM explicitly captures the **temporal structure and behavioral composition of the full 24-hour cycle**, enabling a more precise characterization of lifestyle-related disease risk.

This framework is embedded within a broader analytical pipeline that integrates **epidemiological modeling, temporal representation learning, causal inference, and behavioral optimization**, providing a complete and modular solution for:

- High-resolution temporal behavior representation across the 24-HAC  
- Multimodal disease risk prediction using deep learning (TMRM) 
- Modeling nonlinear and dose–response relationships  
- Mediation and causal inference analyses  
- Personalized and population-level activity optimization strategies
